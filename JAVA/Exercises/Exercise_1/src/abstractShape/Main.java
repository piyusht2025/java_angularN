package abstractShape;

public class Main {
    /* Objective:
Model different geometric shapes using abstraction and calculate their areas.

üîê Rules:

Create an abstract class Shape with an abstract method calculateArea().

Create subclasses Circle, Rectangle, and Square, each implementing the calculateArea() method.

üß± Requirements:

Prompt the user to choose a shape (Circle, Rectangle, or Square).

Based on the shape, prompt for relevant dimensions (radius for circle,
length and width for rectangle, side length for square).

Calculate and display the area of the selected shape.

‚úÖ Optional:

Add more shapes like Triangle and Hexagon.

Use a loop to allow multiple calculations.*/
